# acorn_reinforcement

Reinforcement filament layout optimisation and winding.

This package tackles automated design-to-production of reinforcement layouts using robotic filament winding.
The source code includes the key functions and the example folder suggests an end-to-end workflow to run outside or inside Rhino/Grasshopper.
